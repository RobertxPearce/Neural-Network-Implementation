# Neural Network from Scratch in Python

This repository contains my implementation of a simple neural network, following the guide "Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks" by Victor Zhou. The project explains the basics of neural networks and demonstrates how to build one from scratch in Python. Key concepts include neurons, activation functions, feedforward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation, and training using stochastic gradient descent.

Key Features:
- Introduction to neurons and activation functions
- Implementing a single neuron
- Building a simple neural network
- Training the network using backpropagation
- Example code for a gender prediction task based on weight and height
